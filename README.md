# Pydarknet
This is just a sample code and a script from darknet https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet

I am using chestnut-detection.py with chestnut-picker repo to send detection data for further used.

Both `human-detection.py` and `chectnut-detection.py` are doing the same thing for detecting stuff, showing the video (local or stream) and stream the detection information out for other usage.

human-detection has three cameras supporting, webcam, Intel Realsense D435 and GoPro. For GoPro camera please check on this repo https://github.com/rasheeddo/testGoPro .
